## [Array reverse](challenges/arrayReverse/array-reverse.js)

The challenge is to reverse the order of the elements in a given array (basically, to implement Array.Prototype.reverse()).

I took the aproach to reverse the array 'in-place'. My solution runs in O(n/2) time (linear) and uses O(1) space (constant).

## [Array shift](challenges/arrayShift/array-shift.js)

The challenge is to take in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
