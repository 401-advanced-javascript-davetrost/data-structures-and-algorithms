## [Array reverse](challenges/arrayReverse/array-reverse.js)

The challenge is to reverse the order of the elements in a given array (basically,to implement Array.Prototype.reverse()).

I took the aproach to reverse the array 'in-place'. My solution runs in O(n/2) time (linear) and uses O(1) space (constant).
