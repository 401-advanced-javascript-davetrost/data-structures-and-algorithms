## [Array reverse](challenges/arrayReverse/array-reverse.js)

The challenge is to reverse the order of the elements in a given array (basically, to implement Array.Prototype.reverse()).

I took the aproach to reverse the array 'in-place'. My solution runs in O(n/2) time (linear) and uses O(1) space (constant).

## [Array shift](challenges/arrayShift/array-shift.js)

The challenge is to take in an array and a value to be added. The function returns an array with the new value added at the middle index.

A second function removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.

I took the aproach to shift the array 'in-place'. My solution runs in O(n/2) time (linear) and uses O(1) space (constant).

## [Array Binary Search](challenges/arrayBinarySearch/array-binary-search.js)

The challenge is to search a sorted array for a given search key. The function will return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist. None of the built-in methods will be used. 

### [Runtime Tests](index.js)

This script benchmarks the performance of Array Binary Search against varying array sizes of 100, 10000 and 100000 elements.
